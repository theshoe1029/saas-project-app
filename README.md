# SAAS Project App #

The saas project app is designed to allow project managers to remotely manage their team. It allows user to create workspaces and add teammembers to that workspace that can view a collection of shared files.
**Note: The live version of the saas project app does not allow users to store files to prevent large cloud service charges**
